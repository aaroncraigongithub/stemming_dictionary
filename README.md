## Hunspell Stemming Dictionary

### Description

This project was created to make the Hunspell en_US spelling dictionaries
more appropriate for stemming. They were initaily designed for spelling
and not stemming so there are some obvious problems.

- corner -> corn
- unhappy -> happy
- butter -> butt
